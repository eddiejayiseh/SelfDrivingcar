# SelfDrivingcar
 # üöó Self-Driving / Parking Car (Unity)

A small Unity prototype exploring **basic self-driving and parking behavior** using simple physics and C# scripting.  
Built with **Unity 5 (latest)** as a learning project to experiment with vehicle control, sensors, and decision logic.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This was a **learning experiment**, not a fully functional self-driving system ‚Äî but it taught a lot about how Unity handles physics, colliders, and reinforcement learning!

## üß© Project Overview
The goal was to simulate a car that could:
- Move and steer autonomously  
- Detect nearby obstacles or parking spaces  
- Attempt simple parking maneuvers  

Although not fully successful, it demonstrates the **core building blocks** of vehicle control and environmental awareness in Unity.
